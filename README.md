# dotfiles - wayland
Selection of my .files files for my ricing needs:

swaywm, waybar, kitty, zsh, ...

( + an outdated x11/bspwm set-up)

Necessary submodule is included: ![.scripts](https://github.com/vitezfh/.scripts)

## To-Do

- ~~[ ] separate into branches for work, home, personal laptop~~
    - ~~or just use the config as-is?~~
- ~~[ ] integrate into bootstrap script w/ ansible role/playbook~~
- [ ] move from stow+script to chezmoi
- [X] theming system sync for sway, kitty, waybar, etc.
- [ ] add screencaps
- [ ] ...

## Important Notes

 - Look at the .gitignore file for clues

## Screencaps
OUTDATED: The left is blown up because it's on a notebook; the right is a secondary display.
